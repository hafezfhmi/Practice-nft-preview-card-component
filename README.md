## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Conclusion

- Haven't coded a website for a while. This first project in this challenge is a good refresher.
- Learned to import image from src folder instead of using public folder to store image.
- Although this project is on an easy level, because I haven't practiced much lately, it takes more time than I used to. Back then, I used to take on the harder level challenge and doesn't have much issue building it. Need to practice more constantly.
